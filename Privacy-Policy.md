Aware – Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 04 September 2025

Aware (“the App”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App uses and protects your information.

1. Microphone Access

The App uses your device’s microphone to listen for your name while you are wearing headphones.

This is the core functionality of the App.

2. Speech Recognition

To detect your name, the App uses Google’s speech recognition services.

In some cases, this may require sending short audio snippets to Google’s servers for processing.

The App itself does not record, store, or share any audio.

3. Data Collection

The App does not collect, store, or sell any personal information.

All audio processing is handled either locally on your device (if offline speech recognition is available) or by Google’s servers.

4. Advertising & Purchases

The free version of the App may display advertisements provided by Google AdMob.

The paid version removes ads and allows automatic activation.

Purchases are processed securely by Google Play Billing.

5. Your Choices

You can stop the App at any time by turning off the listening service.

You can uninstall the App at any time to remove all access.

6. Contact
